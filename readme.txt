Make sure to install spinnaker python from whatever hellhole teledyne has stuck it. 

Currently, it's here 
https://www.flir.com/products/spinnaker-sdk

And you'll need to install the full SDK, then the appropriate python wheel. 

The other requirement (dwf, for the analog devices) should automatically install when this package is installed.

To install this package, from the main directory, run:
pip install -e .
